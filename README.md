## Usage
In order to get the app to work first get the backend set up by doing a docker compose up. Once your containers have been created you wil you must open a new terminal and do a node for both migration and seed js then a nodemon for the routes.js. This will let you have the backend working once that has been completed go to the front end folder and do another NPM install then do a npm start to get the app running on the webpage.
